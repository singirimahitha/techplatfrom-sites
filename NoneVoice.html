    In the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) field, a non-voice process refers to tasks that do not involve direct verbal communication with clients.
     These processes primarily rely on written communication, such as email, chat, or documentation, and often involve back-office support functions.
      <br>Examples include data entry, email support, and chat support. 
     Key Characteristics of Non-Voice Processes:
     <br>Focus on written communication:
     Instead of phone calls, communication with clients or customers is handled through text-based channels. 
      <br>Back-office tasks:
      Many non-voice processes involve tasks that are not directly customer-facing, like data entry, HR support, or administrative functions. 
      <br>Data-driven tasks:
      Non-voice processes often involve working with data, whether it's entering, processing, or analyzing information. 
      Emphasis on accuracy and detail:
      Due to the reliance on written communication, accuracy and attention to detail are crucial for successful non-voice processes. 
      <br>Technological support:
      Non-voice processes frequently utilize various software and technology to manage data, communicate with clients, and complete tasks.
