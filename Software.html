    Software development is the process of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining computer programs and applications. 
    It involves activities like analyzing requirements, designing architectures, writing code, testing, deploying,
     and ongoing maintenance of software. Software development is crucial for creating software solutions that meet 
     user needs and can be used in various applications, from operating systems to mobile apps.
      <br>Design:
      This involves planning how the software will work and how users will interact with it.
       It includes creating wireframes, prototypes, and system architecture diagrams. 
       <br>Programming/Coding:
       This is the process of writing the code that instructs the computer what to do. 
       Software developers use programming languages to create the software. 
        <br>Testing:
       This involves checking the software for errors and bugs to ensure it functions correctly. 
       Testing can be done at different levels, from unit tests to integration and system tests. 
         <br>Deployment:
           This is the process of releasing the software to users or integrating it into a system. 
            <br>Maintenance:
           This involves making updates, fixing bugs, and ensuring the software continues to function as expected over time. 
           Software development is an iterative process, meaning that developers often revisit and refine their designs 
           and code as they learn more about the requirements and testing results.
